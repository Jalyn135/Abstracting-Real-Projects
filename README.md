the code tests the Oven class by creating two ovens and showing how they work. It prints the details of both ovens, heats them up by different amounts, and then uses the ovens to bake food or clean themselves. It also shows how to get and change the color of one of the ovens. This helps make sure the Oven class works as expected.
